# tests/conftest.py
"""
Module: conftest.py

This module contains pytest fixtures for End-to-End (E2E) testing of the FastAPI
calculator application using Playwright for browser automation.

Fixtures provided:
- fastapi_server: Starts and manages the FastAPI server for E2E tests
- playwright_instance_fixture: Manages Playwright's lifecycle
- browser: Provides a Chromium browser instance for tests
- page: Creates a new browser page for each test function

These fixtures enable automated browser testing by:
- Starting the FastAPI server in a subprocess
- Waiting for the server to be ready (polling with timeout)
- Launching a headless Chromium browser
- Creating isolated browser pages for each test
- Cleaning up resources after test completion
